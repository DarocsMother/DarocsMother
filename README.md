- 👋 Hi, I’m @DarocsMother
- 👀 I’m interested in digital humanities, particularly literature, double particularly Tolkien's work.  Also, ethical use of text!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to GitHub.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things with Daroc Alden (setupminimal) and James Tauber.  I am, in fact, Daroc's Mother.
